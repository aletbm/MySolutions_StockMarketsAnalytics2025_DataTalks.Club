## About the Course

The **Stock Market Analytics Zoomcamp** is a practical, hands-on program designed to take you from foundational concepts in financial data extraction all the way to building, simulating, and deploying trading strategies. The course covers five main modules plus a final project:

- **Module 1: Introduction and Data Sources**  
  Learn the philosophy of data-driven decision-making, practical setup with Colab, and how to extract financial data from APIs.

- **Module 2: Working with the Data (in Pandas)**  
  Focus on data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis using core Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

- **Module 3: Analytical Modeling**  
  Develop skills in time-series forecasting, regression, and classification to analyze stock market data and predict trends.

- **Module 4: Trading Strategy and Simulation**  
  Design, test, and simulate rule-based trading strategies including portfolio optimization and risk management.

- **Module 5: Deployment and Automation**  
  Learn how to automate workflows, transition from notebooks to production-ready scripts, and deploy trading strategies.
